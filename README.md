# User-Identity-Management

This project is a complete user identity management system that provides a seamless user experience while maintaining data accuracy and security. 
The system allows users to register themselves and receive a unique card similar to an Aadhar card via email. 
The card contains all the necessary user information and serves as a secure identification document.

The system is designed for agencies to manage user profiles and data efficiently. 
Agencies can edit user profiles, maintain user data accuracy, and filter through user data using inbuilt queries built based on DBMS approach. 
The system enables agencies to track down all family members, ensuring comprehensive user management.

### One of the key features of the system is the QR scanning facility, which provides a quick and easy way to retrieve user details. 
The system generates a unique QR code for each user, which can be scanned to obtain all necessary information. 
This feature helps agencies to manage user data more efficiently, reducing the time required to retrieve information.
